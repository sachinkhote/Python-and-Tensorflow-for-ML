## Day 01

Exploring the basics of Tensorflow and its API usage in python  
`api.py`

Exploring **SUPERVISED LEARNING**

i.e.,
- Linear Regression ,
- Logistic Regression,
- Decision Trees ,
- Random Forests ,
- Support Vector Machines(SVM's)

1. **Linear Regression** 

(algorithm used to model the relationship between dependent variable and one or more independent variable. )  
(goal is to find thye best fit line that describes the relationship between variables.)

2. **Logistic Regression**

(used to analyse the datasets with one or more independent variables)  
(useful to predict the probability of an event occuring)  
(in logistic Reg. dependent variable is binary that menas it has only two outcomes i.e., 1 or 0, Yes or No , true or False)

3. **Decision Tree**

(used for both classification and regression tasks)  
(it creates tree like structure which helps us to find out the insights)  
(it generally uses divide_and_conquer strategy.)

4. **Random Forest**  

(This is also used for both classification and regression tasks.)  
(it is known for their ability to handle large datasets while providing accurate predictions.)  
(it is a method which combines multiple decision tree to make prediction.)  
(each single decision tree is built using random subset of trainig data.)
